SPECIFICATION


BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[001]	The present invention is in the technical field of furniture.  More particularly, the present invention is in the technical field of portable seating devices.
[002]	Conventional seating devices, such as rock ledges, tops of stone fences and the like, are typically either immovable or exceedingly difficult to transport.  It is difficult to move these devices into a house or office because they are large and heavy.  Moving such devices typically requires several strong persons, or a sturdy wheeled vehicle such as a reinforced wagon or hand cart.  The difficulties of bringing such a device into a house or office are multiplied when stairs must be climbed.  Further, it is not an uncommon experience to realize that the device cannot pass through the doorway without its widening.  Further, the devices cannot readily be moved from spot to spot once inside a room,    
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention is a seating device for users to sit on having a seating platform supported in an elevated position by a plurality of legs.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING
[003]	Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a seating device of the present invention;
[004]	Fig. 2 is a side view of a seating device of Fig. 1;
[005]	Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a seating device of the present invention;
[006]	Fig. 4 is a side view of a seating device of Fig. 3; and
[007]	Fig. 5 is a perspective view of a seating device of the present invention.
[008]	Fig. 6 is a perspective view of a seating device of the present invention.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
[009]	Referring now to the invention in more detail, in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 there is shown a chair 10 having a seating platform or seat 12 held in a substantially level position elevated above the floor by four upright legs, namely a first leg 14, a second leg 16, a third leg 18 and a fourth leg 20.  Each of the legs 14, 16, 18, 20 is attached to the underside of the seat 12 near or proximate a corner of the seat 12.
[0010]	In further detail, still referring to the invention of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the seat 12 is sufficiently wide and long for comfortable seating, such as about 15 to 20 inches deep and about 15 to about 22 inches wide.  The legs 14, 16, 18, 20 are sufficiently tall to hold the seat 12 a comfortable distance off the ground, such as about 15 to 22 inches off the ground.
[0011]	The construction details of the invention as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are that the chair 10 may be made of wood or of any other sufficiently rigid and strong material such as high-strength plastic, metal, and the like.  Further, the various components of the chair 10 can be made of different materials.
[0012]	Referring now to Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, there is shown a chair 50 having a seating platform or seat 52 held in a substantially level position elevated above the floor by four upright legs, namely a first leg 54, a second leg 56, a third leg 58 and a fourth leg 60.  Each of the legs 54, 56, 58 and 60 is attached to the underside of the seat 52 near or proximate a corner of the seat 52.
[0013]	In more detail, still referring to the invention of Fig. 2, the chair 10 as shown includes a back rest 62 and two spaced-apart arm rests 64, 66, each of which is secured to the top side or to the sides of the seat 52 of the chair 50.
[0014]	In further detail, still referring to the invention of Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the seat 52 is sufficiently wide and long for comfortable seating, such as about 15 to 20 inches deep and about 15 to about 22 inches wide.  The legs 54, 56, 58 and 60 are sufficiently tall to hold the seat 52 a comfortable distance off the ground, such as about 15 to 22 inches off the ground.
[0015]	The construction details of the invention as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 are that the chair 50 may be made of wood or of any other sufficiently rigid and strong material such as high-strength plastic, metal, and the like.  Further, the various components of the chair 50 can be made of different materials.
[0016]	Referring now to Fig. 5, there is shown a stool 110 having a seating platform or seat 112 held in a substantially level position elevated above the floor by three upright legs, namely a first leg 114, a second leg 116, and a third leg 118.  Each of the legs 54, 56, 58 and 60 is attached to the underside of the seat 112.
[0017]	In further detail, still referring to the invention of Fig. 5, the seat 112 has a substantially circular profile which is of a sufficient diameter, for instance a diameter of about 15 to 20 inches.  The legs 114, 116, 118 are sufficiently tall to hold the seat 112 a comfortable distance off the ground, such as about 15 to 22 inches off the ground.
[0018]	The construction details of the invention as shown in Fig. 5 are that the stool 100 may be made of wood or of any other sufficiently rigid and strong material such as high-strength plastic, metal, and the like.  Further, the various components of the stool 100 can be made of different materials.
[0019]	Referring now to Fig. 6, there is shown a stool 150 having a seating platform or seat 152 held in a substantially level position elevated above the floor by a single upright leg 154.  The leg 154 is mounted on a base 164 of sufficient bulk and weight to stabilize the stool 150.
[0020]	The advantages of the present invention include, without limitation, that it is portable and exceedingly easy to transport.  It is easy to move these devices into a house or office because they are relatively small and lightweight.  Moving such devices typically requires a single person, and typically at most two persons when taking the device up or down stairs.  Further, the devices generally will pass through most doorways without any widening.  Further, the devices can easily be moved from spot to spot once inside a room,    
[0021]	In broad embodiment, the present invention is a seat elevated above the ground by at least one upright leg member.
[0022]	While the foregoing written description of the invention enables one of ordinary skill to make and use what is considered presently to be the best mode thereof, those of ordinary skill will understand and appreciate the existence of variations, combinations, and equivalents of the specific embodiment, method, and examples herein. The invention should therefore not be limited by the above described embodiment, method, and examples, but by all embodiments and methods within the scope and spirit of the invention as claimed.
ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE
A seating device has a seating platform and at least one leg supporting it in its elevated position.
